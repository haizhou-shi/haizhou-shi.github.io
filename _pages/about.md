Welcome to my personal website! I'm Haizhou Shi (Âè≤Êµ∑Ëàü), a second-year Ph.D. student in the [CS Department at Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu), working under the guidance of Prof. [Hao Wang](http://wanghao.in). *My research centers on enhancing machine learning models' generalization abilities, enabling them to adapt quickly to evolving learning tasks and data distributions.*

Previous to that, I earned my M.S. and B.S. degrees from the [CS Department at Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn) in 2022 and 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/siliang) and [Yueting Zhuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yzhuang). During that time, my focus was on developing generalizable representations in various scenarios, including unsupervised, weakly-supervised, federated, and continual learning.

**Job Hunting**: I am now actively looking for the internship opportunity in Summer 2024! *I am interested in working on the topics of (but not limited to) continual pre-training/adaptation for LLMs/large generative models.*
Please contact me if you are interested (and happen to have an opening position in your team ü•π)!

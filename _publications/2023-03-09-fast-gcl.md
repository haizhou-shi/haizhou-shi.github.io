title: "Structure-Aware Group Discrimination with Adaptive-View Graph Encoder: A Fast Graph Contrastive Learning Framework"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-09-fast-gcl
tldr: 'A fast graph contrastive learning framework is proposed, which consists of two components: (i) adaptive view graph encoder (AVGE) and (ii) structure-aware group discrimination loss (SAGD). The proposed method manages to bring down the training and inference cost by a significant margin compared to its counterparts.'

title: "BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-17-blob
tldr: "We propose a Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation framework for LLMs that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process, which effectively alleviates the problem of LLMs' overconfidence."

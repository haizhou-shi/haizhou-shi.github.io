title: "BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models"
collection: publications

tldr: 'We propose a Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation framework for LLMs that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process, which effectively alleviates the problem of LLMs' overconfidence.'

title: "SSR: Socratic Self-Refine for Large Language Model Reasoning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-11-15-ssr
tldr: "We introduce Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a fine-grained test-time reasoning framework that decomposes model outputs into verifiable sub-steps, identifies unreliable reasoning through targeted re-solving and consistency checks, and iteratively refines errors to produce more accurate and interpretable solutions, achieving consistent gains over prior self-refinement methods across multiple benchmarks and models."

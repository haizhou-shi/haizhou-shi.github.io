title: "A Unified Approach to Domain Incremental Learning with Memory: Theory and Algorithm"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-09-20-udil
tldr: 'A novel theoretical framework, UDIL, is proposed for domain incremental learning, unifying multiple existing methods. The key insight of our study is that UDIL allows for adaptive coefficients during training, yielding a tighter generalization bound compared to its counterparts.'

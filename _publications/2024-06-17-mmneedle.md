title: "Multimodal Needle in a Haystack: Benchmarking Long-Context Capability of Multimodal LLMs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-17-mmneedle
tldr: "We discuss the MMNeedle benchmark, a new tool for evaluating how well Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) handle long-context tasks. The benchmark tests MLLMs' ability to find specific sub-images within larger image sets based on text instructions. Using techniques like image stitching, it creates longer visual contexts for testing."

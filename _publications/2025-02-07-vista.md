title: "The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-02-07-vista
tldr: "We examined how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process visual and textual information, discovering they gradually lose visual context during generation. Based on these insights, we developed VISTA, a training-free framework that reinforces visual information and leverages early layer activations to reduce hallucinations by approximately 40%. Our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks and architectures, working with various decoding strategies without requiring extra supervision."

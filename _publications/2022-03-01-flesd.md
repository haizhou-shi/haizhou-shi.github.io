title: "Towards Communication-efficient and Privacy-preserving Federated Representation Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-03-01-flesd
tldr: 'Based on the observed robustness against data i.i.d.-ness of contrastive methods, a similarity-based distillation method is used to design a novel federated representation learning framework, FLESD, which is verified to be more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving.'

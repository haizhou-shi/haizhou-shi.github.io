title: "CIL: Contrastive Instance Learning Framework for Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-06-01-cil
tldr: 'This paper goes beyond typical multi-instance learning (MIL) framework and propose a novel contrastive instance learning (CIL) framework for distantly supervised relation extraction. Specifically, we regard the initial MIL as the relational triple encoder and constraint positive pairs against negative pairs for each instance.'

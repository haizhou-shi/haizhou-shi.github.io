title: "TokUR: Token-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Model Reasoning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-09-23-tokur
tldr: "We introduce TokUR, a method for estimating response-level uncertainty in Large Language Model reasoning without additional training. TokUR works by injecting low-rank weight perturbations within certain constraints, achieving better performance in dehallucination detection and test-time scaling compared to existing methods."

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-01-raft
tldr: 'In this paper, we suggest understanding <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07733.pdf">BYOL</a> from the view of our proposed interpretable self-supervised learning framework, Run Away From your Teacher (RAFT). It optimizes two objectives at the same time: (i) aligning two views of the same data and (ii) running away from the modelâ€™s Mean Teacher (MT). Theoretical justification is also provided for equating the proposed RAFT and BYOL under certain conditions.'
